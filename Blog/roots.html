            <i>Written by <a href="https://drkeefy.medium.com/">drkeefy</a></i>
           <P>
          Imagine it everyday, you wake up, you open your computer, and you press "GO LIVE." You go live everyday, every week, sometimes every hour. You are an entertainer. Ranking in money from streaming, bringing cash from playing games. And then on top of that, you get to play games continuously. You're living the dream!
<br><br>
          But, nobody askes how the entertainer is doing. Underneathe the funny livestreamer personality is a person who struggles with mental illness. Someone who pops pills and does drugs to make sure they can stream everyday. That person was me.
<br><br>
PGWECN was a fun project to bring light into my society, but it wasn't perfect. I couldn't help everyone, and I struggled to take care of my community. After a while, people left, and as activity slowed, I felt sickened. I didn't want it to end like this, but here it is.  I spent countless hours redesigning PGWECN trying to figure out what would be the best for PGWECN. But the simple answer was, it was outdated, and there wasn't much I can do. So please, stay in this Discord, and follow us on Twitter. Hopefully, we'll be coming back soon


<br><br>
PGWECN's Discord is officially over. But we'll likely be doing something in the future, so please follow us on Twitter, and keep up with this website.
<br><br>
One way or another, we'll be back soon.
<br><br>
Live, Laugh, Stay special!
