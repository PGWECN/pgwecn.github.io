    <div class="text">Dorks & Dreads is PGWECN's seasonal Dungeons and Dragons game! It's hosted on AllanWench's channel! Which you can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@allanwench/featured">here</a>
    
    <h1>Season 1: "Trenches, Bullets, & Hell"</h1>
    <p>Season 1 of Dorks and Dreads is based in the world of Mojan, made by AllanWench, this world is a planet with Three Suns, and two moons. The two moons represent the worlds two oldest evils, and the two suns represent the divine brothers who created the world. In this story, the <a href="#characters">Characters</a>
    Work for a group known as the Malgave Federation, which is akin to the real world Allied powers. The characters each work for different organizations, however the organizations are allied and are not in opposing sides of the war. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In this campaign, the characters begin stationed at the city of Loromir because of their organization. During this time of being stationed there, Axis planes bomb the city, consuming it with fire. The characters play in the Archum Hall, the meeting hall of the city of Loromir. The two parties, Players 1 & Plaers 2 were separated from the other two players.
    <br>
    <br>
    A NPC character, called "Dean Haskar" saves the characters to the best of his abilities and helps them. Though it seems he has his own motives. And he needs the help of the characters to achieve them. I wonder where this journey will lead our characters. To a high point in the battle between the Federation and Axis? Or simple grunt work 
    <h2>Watch now to find out!</h2>
