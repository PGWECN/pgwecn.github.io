            <h1> Back in 2020...
            </h1>
        </center>
        <p>A man named, <a href="https://keithkhaotic.is-a.dev">Doctor Keefy</a>, started a Discord server! At first, he couldn't think of a name, his prior projects didn't have the best names, and he wanted this one to be <EM>Perfect!</EM> He thought for a minute, but remained indecisive.
        <br>
        <br>
         A few weeks later, he and his schoolyard friends were talking. They wanted to start a band. After some debate, they decided to combine some of their favorite things. And do you know what these things were?
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li> The color Purple(P)</li>
        <li>Giraffes(G)</li>
        <li>Eating(E)</li>
        <li>Chicken(C)</li>
        <li>And of course Nuggets(N)</li>
    </ul>
<br>
        Obviously that didn't sound right at all! So they did something <em>SPIFFY!</em> They combined all of them. Thus, PGWECN was born! Purple(P) Giraffes(G) Who(W) Eat(E) Chicken(C) Nuggets(N)
<br>
<br>
As you probably could guess, PGWECN never became a band. But what it did become was the name for his server. The Official PGWECN Discord!</p>
<hr class="rounded">
<center><h1>How did a band name become a therapy brand?</h1></center>
<p>Obviously that's quite hard to explain. But let's just say our gregarious founder had found himself a love interest he fell head-over-heels for. And not to get all dismal, she didn't reciprocate such feelings(RIP For da Homie Keefy :c)
<br>
<br>
But that love interest had actually landed him somewhere. Patient Zero. That's what SHE was to him. the person who had sprouted his desire and want to help others. Thus, he stopped dead in his tracks.
<br>
<br>
No more was PGWECN about gaming or just a simple chatting server. Now, it's drive, it's mission was to help others.
