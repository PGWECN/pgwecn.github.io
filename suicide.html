<div class="text"><p> PGWECN is a group of Content Creators, artists, musicians, gamers, YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, all in one! We're both on <a href="https://dsc.gg/giraffe">Discord</a> And <a href="https://guilded.gg/keefy">Keefy's Guilded</a>
<br>
<br>
Founded in 2020, by Doctor Keefy(or Keith Counts), it's slowly become more than it's original plan. PGWECN started out with a group of YouTubers wanting to expand, and have a community of their own. But eventually, it began to expand it's sights. PGWECN now offers(both on Discord & lightly on Guilded) forms of teletherapy, friend-seeking, ticket-therapy, and unlicensed teletherapy

<br>
<br>
PGWECN has below a list of resources, places, and things for anyone who needs a hand in a mentally-unwell station.
These include:
<li>
    Suicide.
    </li>
    <li>More coming soon</li>
